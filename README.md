Hello world! 🌎👋
My name is Julieta Magnago, and I am originally from Argentina, but currently based in Hamburg, Germany.

I am a highly motivated individual who previously worked as a model. However, I realized that my energy was better suited to a more intelectually challenging, limitless career. I am now a Full-Stack Developer, which is much more fulfilling. My main strengths include creative problem-solving, a passion for continuous learning and improvement, and effective communication skills.

🛠️👨‍💻 My technical expertise includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, SQL, Sequelize, Express, and MongoDB.

In addition, I am fluent in both Spanish and English and have an A2 proficiency level in German.
