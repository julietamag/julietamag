Hello my name is Julieta Magnago, I am from Argentina but currently based in Hamburg, Germany.

I have been a fashion model my whole life, but now I am studying Web Development as a career change in FreeCodeCamp and CodeAcademy as a starter. 

My interest are: arts and crafts, outdoor activities, tech and cooking.
